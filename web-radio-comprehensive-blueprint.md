# Comprehensive Blueprint for Collaborative Web Radio App

## Core Technology Stack

### Server Environment
- **Heroku** (Free tier) - Platform for hosting the application

### Backend Runtime
- **Node.js** - Efficient event-driven server environment

### Frontend Framework
- **Vue.js** - Progressive framework for UI components and reactivity

### Database
- **MongoDB Atlas** (Free tier) - Document database for user and song metadata

### Real-time Communication
- **Socket.io** - WebSocket library for synchronized playback and control

### File Storage
- **Cloudinary** (Free tier) - For audio file storage and streaming

### Process Management
- **PM2** - Node.js process manager to handle clustering and restarts

### API Architecture
- **Express.js** - Lightweight web framework for RESTful API endpoints

### Authentication
- **Auth0** (Free tier) - User authentication and management

### CSS Framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design

## Implementation Architecture

### User Flow
1. User registers/logs in via Auth0
2. Uploads audio files to Cloudinary via direct upload
3. Media metadata stored in MongoDB
4. Real-time playback state synchronized via Socket.io
5. Playback controls affect all connected users

### Data Models

#### User Model
- Basic profile information
- Upload history
- Permissions level

#### Track Model
- Metadata (title, artist, duration)
- Cloudinary URL
- Upload timestamp
- Uploader reference

#### Room Model
- Current playlist
- Connected users
- Current playback state
- Control history

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- Registration/login routes
- User profile management

#### Media Management
- Upload endpoint (generating Cloudinary signature)
- Library browsing and search
- Playlist management

#### Room Control
- Create/join listening rooms
- Manage permissions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialize Node.js project
- Configure Express server
- Set up MongoDB connection
- Implement basic Vue.js frontend

### 2. Authentication System
- Integrate Auth0 for user management
- Create login/signup flows
- Implement permission system

### 3. File Upload System
- Configure Cloudinary integration
- Create direct upload functionality
- Implement file validation and metadata extraction

### 4. Database Schema
- Design and implement MongoDB schemas
- Create data access layer
- Set up indexes for query optimization

### 5. Real-time Communication
- Configure Socket.io server
- Implement room-based connections
- Create synchronization protocol

### 6. Playback System
- Build audio player component using Web Audio API
- Create playback state management
- Implement synchronized controls

### 7. Queue Management
- Design collaborative queue system
- Implement add/remove/reorder functionality
- Create voting system for song selection

### 8. User Interface
- Build responsive control panel
- Create library browsing interface
- Implement chat functionality

### 9. Optimization
- Configure proper caching headers
- Implement resource limiting to stay within free tiers
- Create content rotation system for storage management

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Simultaneous Playback Synchronization
- Solution: Server-side timestamp coordination with client-side drift correction

### Challenge: Limited Storage Space
- Solution: Automatic content rotation based on popularity and age

### Challenge: Bandwidth Constraints
- Solution: Dynamic quality adjustment based on connection speed and concurrent users

### Challenge: Free Tier Limitations
- Solution: Intelligent resource management with graceful degradation

## Deployment Workflow

### Development Environment
- Local Node.js server
- Local MongoDB instance
- Development Cloudinary account

### Production Deployment
1. Deploy backend to Heroku
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up MongoDB Atlas connection
4. Link Cloudinary production account
5. Configure Socket.io for production

### Monitoring
- Implement simple logging system
- Set up usage alerts for free tier limits
- Create admin dashboard for system health

## Storage Management Strategy

### Upload Process
1. Client requests signed upload URL from server
2. Direct upload to Cloudinary bypassing Heroku
3. Server receives completion webhook
4. Metadata stored in MongoDB

### Content Rotation
- Track play counts and last-played date
- Automatically archive least popular content when approaching storage limits
- Implement "cold storage" concept for rarely played tracks

### Bandwidth Optimization
- Implement progressive audio loading
- Use appropriate audio formats (MP3 for compatibility)
- Configure proper caching to reduce redundant downloads
